### NLP Chatbot Deployment on AWS

**Note**: Make sure you have Python3 and pip installed if you have a Windows machine.

If you don't have them installed, please install an ubuntu VM using Virtualbox (recommended). You can follow the steps given in this link: https://itsfoss.com/install-linux-in-virtualbox/

You need not do anything if you have Linux or a Mac.
